<- Vector ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The Vector class allows you to do some operations with vectors.

It operates with Vertex class, so to create a vector, you need to pass the next
parameters:

(mandatory) 'dest' - the vector’s destination vertex,
(optional) 'orig' - the vector’s origin vertex.

If 'orig doesn't exist, its default value is vertex with (x=0, y=0, z=0, w=1).

The syntax is:

	$new_vector = new Vector( array( 'orig' => $orig, 'dest' => $dest ) );

where 'orig' and 'dest' are Vertex' objects created earlier.

The Vertex class parameters ('x', 'y', 'z' and 'w') are private
and can be READ ONLY using accessors (the syntax is usual).
Created vector couldn't be modified.

Also, there some useful methods to operate with your vectors:
*	float magnitude() : returns the vector’s length (or "norm").
*	Vector normalize() : returns a normalized version of the vector. If the
		vector is already normalized, returns a fresh copy of the vector.
*	Vector add(Vector $rhs) : returns the sum vector of both vectors.
*	Vector sub(Vector $rhs) : returns the difference vector of both vectors.
*	Vector opposite() : returns the opposite vector.
*	Vector scalarProduct($k) : returns the multiplication of the vector
		with a scalar.
*	float dotProduct(Vector $rhs) : returns the scalar multiplication
		of both vectors.
*	float cos(Vector $rhs) : returns the angle’s cosine between both vec- tors.
*	Vector crossProduct(Vector $rhs) : returns the cross multiplication
		of both vectors (right-hand mark)
